    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="IMG_1953.jpeg" alt="ProfilePicture" width="500" height="600">
    <p>I'm a PhD student studying Biomedical Data Science at UW-Madison. My path to where I am is
    a bit unconventional, but I'm excited to be here and to learn more about data science. Before
    joining the current program, I was a doctoral student in Educational Psychology at UW-Madison.
    During my previous graduate study, I was interested in infant brain development and got hands-on
    experiences with neuroimaging data. To know more about the algorithms and tools used in the field,
    I started to take courses in computer science and statistics, and was impressed by the power of machine
    learning in analyzing complex biomedical data, such as time-series data and imaging data. As I gained
    more knowledge and hands-on research experiences, I decided to switch my career path to biomedical data
    science, with a focus on developing machine learning algorithms for analyzing complex biomedical data.

    <h2>Ongoing Projects</h2>
    <h3>Project 1: Sleep or Awake: EEG Data Analysis</h3>
    <p>This project aims to identify the patterns in EEG data during REM sleep and 
        awake status. The REM stage, which is also know and disconnected consiousness, is a stage of sleep that
        shows resembled brain activity to the awake status. By identifying the patterns in EEG data during REM,
        we hope to better understand the brain activity during REM and its relationship with the awake status.
        Potential applications of this project include improving the diagnosis of sleep disorders, sleep quality
        monitoring, and anethesia planning.</p>
    <h3>Project 2: Neonatal Encephalopathy Diagnosis with CTG Data</h3>
    <p>This project aims to build a deep learning classifier that can effectively identify neonates with elevated
        risk of encephalopathy based on their CTG data. Neonatal encephalopathy is a serious condition that can lead
        to long-term neurological deficits or even death. Early diagnosis of neonatal encephalopathy is critical for
        timely intervention and treatment. The challenges include the small sample size, the varied length
        of CTG signals among individuals, and the high dimensionality of the data. We are currently exploring different
        deep learning architectures and data augmentation techniques to improve the performance of the classifier.</p>
