      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="IMG_1953.jpeg" alt="Profile picture of Xiaoxu Rong" class="profile-img" />
      <p>
        I’m a Ph.D. student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, working at the intersection of machine learning and biomedical data. I transitioned into Biomedical Data Science from Educational Psychology, drawn by the potential of algorithms to make sense of complex datasets like neuroimaging and CTG signals.
      </p>
      <p>
        My research focuses on deep learning models applied to clinical problems, especially where data are high-dimensional, multimodal, or scarce. I'm passionate about building tools that improve diagnostics and understanding in medical settings.
        On theoretical side, I'm interested in clustering and representation learning, particularly in how to make models more interpretable and robust.

      <h2>Ongoing Projects</h2>

      <h3>1. Multimodal Deep Learning for Ovarian Cancer</h3>
      <p>
        We're adapting BiomedCLIP to ovarian cancer data for diagnostic classification, clinical report generation, and VQA. Supervised by Dr. Irene Ong, this project bridges text and image modalities in a challenging domain where biopsy isn’t practical.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Regularized Iterative Cone Clustering (RICC)</h3>
      <p>
        RICC is our solution to the ill-posed nature of NMF. By incorporating subspace structure, it improves stability and interpretability of parts-based representation for biomedical data.
      </p>

      <h3>3. CTG-Based Diagnosis of Neonatal Encephalopathy</h3>
      <p>
        We are designing a deep learning model for early diagnosis of neonatal encephalopathy from CTG signals. The project tackles high-dimensional data, variable lengths, and low sample sizes with augmentation and novel architectures.

      <h2>Personal Life</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of research, I enjoy baking bread — especially sourdough — and exploring local cafés. I also love rock climbing (mostly indoor) and snowboarding.
      </p>
      <p>
        I share my home with two lovely cats (or maybe the cats share home with me?):
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Boba</strong>: a small black American long-hair, curious and playful</li>
          <li><strong>Nemo</strong>: a large tuxedo grey-and-white American short-hair, gentle and sleepy</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        They’ve accompanied me across the country, and bring joy to my daily life.
